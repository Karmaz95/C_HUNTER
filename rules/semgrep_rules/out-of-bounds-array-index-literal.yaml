# This Semgrep rule detects a potential out-of-bounds array index.
# It looks for code where:
# 1. An array is declared with a literal size (captured as $X).
# 2. Later, an assignment is made using the same literal ($X) as the index.
# Using the declared size as an index is likely out-of-bounds since valid indices are 0 to size-1.
