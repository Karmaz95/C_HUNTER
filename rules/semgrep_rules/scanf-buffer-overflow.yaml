# It detects buffer overflows caused by unsafe use of scanf in C/C++.
#
# The rule captures:
# 1. Usage of `scanf`, `sscanf`, or `fscanf` without a field width specifier.
# 2. These functions read input into a fixed-size buffer without limiting input size.
# 3. Matches cases where user input is read directly into a buffer without specifying a safe length.
#
# This rule detects CWE-120 (Buffer Copy Without Checking Size of Input).
