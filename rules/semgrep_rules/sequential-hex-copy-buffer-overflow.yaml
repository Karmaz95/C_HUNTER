# This Semgrep rule is named sequential-hex-copy-buffer-overflow.
# It detects a potential buffer overflow vulnerability when a loop sequentially
# copies hex data into a fixed-size destination buffer without verifying that
# the destination buffer is large enough to hold the copied data.
# The rule is generic and can match similar patterns in C/C++ code.
