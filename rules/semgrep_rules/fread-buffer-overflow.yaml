# This Semgrep rule is named fread-buffer-overflow.
# It detects a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in C/C++ code where:
# 1. A fixed-size two-dimensional array of type 'uchar' is declared.
# 2. A variable is assigned the return value of read_dword(), which indicates untrusted input.
# 3. The variable is used (after casting to size_t) as the count argument in a call to fread(),
#    potentially reading more data than the allocated array can hold.
#
# The ellipses (...) are used as wildcards to allow matching of code with additional tokens or lines.
rules:
- id: fread-buffer-overflow
  patterns:
  # The pattern to match code that might be vulnerable.
