# It detects buffer overflows caused by unsafe use of strcat in C/C++.
#
# The rule captures:
# 1. Usage of `strcat` or `strncat` where no explicit size check is performed.
# 2. `strcat` appends a string without checking if the destination buffer is large enough.
# 3. Matches cases where `strcat` or `strncat` could overflow a buffer.
#
# This rule detects CWE-120 (Buffer Copy Without Checking Size of Input).
