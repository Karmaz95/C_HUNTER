# It detects buffer overflows caused by unsafe use of sprintf in C/C++.
#
# The rule captures:
# 1. Usage of `sprintf` that writes into a fixed-size buffer.
# 2. `sprintf` does NOT perform bounds checking, which can lead to overflows.
# 3. Matches cases where `sprintf` is used instead of safer alternatives.
#
# This rule detects CWE-120 (Buffer Copy Without Checking Size of Input).
